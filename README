This program was written to provide -L and -R like options in ssh(1) for
normal shell.

If use a client program and a server program (just same program with
different options) to provide this possibility.

Client program (launched from yuor machine) launch a ssh to your server
(you can change launched program using --shell options).

In your server launch the program with --server options, this launch a shell.

Now you can do whatever you want and use your port redirected !!!

For technical info see note.txt, in summary server and client detect some
special format in normal flow that are threated like data from sockets or
control informations.

One of the main use it's to use in a compile farm to test some client program
without installing server one (for example cause you can't install it
or it's too heavy... consider a proprietary database)
