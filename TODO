. support for redirection of stream (in, out, err)
. no-blocking connect
. ip specification for -L
. man page
. more options (magic char, blocking data limits)
. more than 255 channels ??
. ip v6 ??
. port to win ?? Use cygwin
. ftp emulation ??

tests:
. long output should not be truncated for buffer problem, consider
  ./src/shtunnel -L 12345::23456 localhost cat $PWD/src/shtunnel.c
. using this command server seems to not catch all characters
  (connect and hit some char like 'qqqq' without enter)
  ./src/shtunnel -L 12345::23456 localhost -- $PWD/src/shtunnel --server
  The problem is that ssh launched by client have tty not in raw mode so
  it wait for enter to get line and send to server pipe (it do not create
  a pty for server cause it do not use pty to execute commands)
  A workaround it to use -t option to ssh (--shell 'ssh -t')
